# posenet_minigame

In this project, I develop the interactive web game using ml5.js framework. The web camera detect the user face, specifically recognizing the user's noise by trained PoseNet. Use have to catch a grey ball falling from top to down. Graphics interactions are implemented using p5.js as a main supported JavaScript library.
